![DESC IMG](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/t1/T186VQOQFRJN1622064439114.png)

This App, is designed to serve as a repository of information based on Blizzard Entertainment's card game titled Hearthstone. Using the app, users can search for a multitude of different cards data. Users that have registered can save popular cards to their 'collections' and use these collections to theorycraft their own personal decks.


## Inspiration
Back in 2014, I remember playing Hearthstone a lot while finishing my college education. The release of the game is very nostalgic and doing this project reminded me how fun it was!
